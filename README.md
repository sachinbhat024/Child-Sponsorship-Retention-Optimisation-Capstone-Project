# DA-in-Practice-Rename

During my capstone unit at the university, I collaborated with a team of students to work on an industry clientâ€™s dataset (World Vision Australia). Leveraging different data science skills, we assessed their business operations, identified critical challenges, and provided data-driven, actionable solutions. This project gave me valuable experience in working with real-world data to solve complex business problems, further refining my analytical and problem-solving skills in a professional setting.
