# Enhancing Child Sponsorship Retention for World Vision Australia

During my capstone unit at the university, I collaborated with a team of students to work on an industry clientâ€™s dataset (World Vision Australia). Leveraging different data science skills, we assessed their business operations, identified critical challenges, and provided data-driven, actionable solutions. This project gave me valuable experience in working with real-world data to solve complex business problems, further refining my analytical and problem-solving skills in a professional setting.

Business Problems:
1.	Declining Child Sponsorship Retention: Retention rates for child sponsorships have declined by 48% over the past three years, posing a serious risk to vital child development programs.
2.	Ineffective Donor Segmentation: The existing segmentation model fails to meet donor needs. High churn persists across segments, and our most generous donors in the "Null" segment remain unsegmented due to significant data gaps.

Key Insights:
1.	Churn Trends: Over the past three years, 48% of child sponsorships ended, with the highest churn occurring in 2023. This trend necessitates immediate action to stabilize sponsorship levels.
2.	Communication Impact: There is a clear correlation between communication volume and retention. Periods of increased communication corresponded with lower churn rates, highlighting the need for consistent donor engagement.
3.	Segment-Specific Issues: High churn rates in Segments 3 and 5, despite significant communication efforts, indicate that the current segmentation model is not addressing donor needs effectively. Additionally, the "Null" segment, which includes the highest-paying donors, is not segmented, leading to missed engagement opportunities.

Modelling Insights:
1.	Churn Prediction Accuracy: Our logistic regression model accurately identified at-risk donors with an accuracy of 89.31%, enabling proactive retention efforts.
2.	New Clustering Model: We developed a new segmentation model based on donor behaviour, identifying five distinct clusters. This model allows for more personalized and effective communication strategies.

Recommendations:
1.	Enhanced Segmentation: Implement the new clustering model, that leverages donor communication and donation patterns, eliminating the need for demographic information, to ensure personalized communication strategies for all donor segments, particularly high-value donors.
2.	Consistent Communication: Maintain regular and meaningful interactions with donors, especially during critical periods, to prevent churn. Tailor communication content and delivery methods based on donor preferences and behaviours.
3.	Proactive Retention Efforts: Use the predictive model to identify at-risk donors and implement targeted retention strategies.
